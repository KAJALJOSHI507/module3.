            Once a young man asked the wise man, Socrates,  
            the secret to success. Socrates patiently listened to the man’s question and 
            told him to meet him near the river the next morning for the answer. 
            The next morning Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river.
            As they went in the river  the water got up to their neck. But to the young man’s 
            surprise Socrates ducked him into the water.The young man struggled to get 
            out of the water, but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy 
            started turning blue.Socrates pulled the man’s head out of the water. 
            The young man gasps and took a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, ‘What did 
            you want the most when your head was in the water?” The young man replied, “Air.” 
            Socrates said, “That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly 
            as you wanted the air while you were in the water, then you will get it. 
            There is no other secret.”

			It was one of the coldest winter and many animals were dying because of the
                    cold. The porcupines, realizing the situation, decided to group together to
                    keep each other warm. This was a great way to protect themselves from cold 
                    and keep each of them warm; but the quills of each one wounded their closest 
                    companions.After a while, they decided to distance themselves, but  they too 
                    began to die due to cold. So they had to make a choice: either accept the quills 
                    of their companions or choose death. Wisely, they decided to go back to being 
                    together. They learned to live with the little wounds caused by the close 
                    relationship with their companions in order to receive the warmth of their 
                    togetherness. This way they were able to survive

            A farmer had a dog who used to wait by the roadside for vehicles to come. 
            As soon as one came, he would run down the road, barking and trying to overtake the vehicle. 
            
            One day the farmer’s neighbour asked the farmer “Do you think the dog is ever going to 
            overtake those vehicles?” The farmer replied, “That is not what bothers me.
            What bothers me is what he would do if he ever caught one.”
            Many people in life behave like that dog who is pursuing meaningless goals
